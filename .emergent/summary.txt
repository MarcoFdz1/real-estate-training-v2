The previous AI engineer initiated the task by taking over an existing Real Estate Training Platform application (video management system) already migrated from localStorage to MongoDB. The initial phase involved understanding the codebase, verifying the environment, and fixing a hardcoded backend URL in the frontend. Following successful initial setup and backend testing, the user provided detailed requirements for feature enhancements, including an integrated video player, progress tracking, improved UI, and a comprehensive admin panel.

The engineer then implemented these features, making significant changes to both backend (FastAPI models and endpoints for progress tracking) and frontend (new React components like , , , , , and extensive updates to ).

The project then entered a protracted debugging phase focused on deployment to Railway and Vercel. This involved numerous iterations of Dockerfile corrections (switching from npm <command>

After successfully deploying the base application, the user reported that many of the developed features were inexplicably missing from the deployed version. The current work involves diagnosing this discrepancy and re-implementing or fixing the missing functionalities, starting with the frontend  and planning subsequent backend updates.

<product_requirements>
The user manages a Real Estate Training Platform, primarily a video management system. The initial application featured video content storage (previously localStorage, now MongoDB) and basic user management.

The core problem the user is addressing is the need to transform this basic MVP into a more complete, modern, and user-friendly platform. Explicit feature requests and desired improvements include:

1.  **Integrated Video Player:** Ability to watch videos directly within the platform.
2.  **Improved Video Card Design:** Larger thumbnails, better information display for video listings.
3.  **Video Detail Page:** A dedicated page for each video with full information and an integrated player.
4.  **Progress Dashboard:** Track user viewing progress for videos.
5.  **Modern UI/UX:** Better design, animations, and overall user experience.
6.  **Real-time Preview:** See changes before saving.
7.  **Better Visual Organization:** Clearer sections and improved layout.
8.  **Visual Confirmations:** Toast notifications for saved changes.

After initial deployment, the user reported the following missing or incomplete functionalities, indicating these are critical product requirements that still need to be fully implemented in the deployed version:
1.  Option to change video thumbnails and manage them completely.
2.  Ability to create or edit categories.
3.  Ensure the dark background is truly .
4.  Ability to edit any video's full details.
5.  Ability to edit texts on the portada (landing page).
6.  Users can be created, but new users are not recognized/cannot log in.
7.  Fields that should be optional are currently mandatory.

<pending_tasks>
The following functionalities/issues were explicitly reported by the user as missing or not working in the currently deployed version and are still pending full resolution:
-   Implementing an option to change video thumbnail images and manage them completely.
-   Enabling the creation and editing of categories.
-   Adjusting the dark background to be a solid .
-   Allowing comprehensive editing of any video's details.
-   Providing the ability to edit texts displayed on the landing page (portada).
-   Resolving the issue where newly created users are not recognized or cannot log in despite being saved.
-   Modifying input fields to allow them to be left empty if desired, rather than enforcing mandatory input.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had completed an extensive debugging and deployment process. The application's backend (FastAPI) and frontend (React) were successfully deployed to Railway and Vercel respectively, and MongoDB Atlas was connected. Initial tests of the backend API and frontend loading were successful.

However, upon user testing (Chat Message 393), it became apparent that the deployed version lacked several key functionalities that had been developed in the Emergent environment. The user explicitly stated, Como que los cambios de la main3 no se hicieron en la ultima versión, indicating a discrepancy between the local  branch's capabilities and the deployed application.

The AI engineer acknowledged this critical issue (Chat Message 394) and began to address it. The immediate work involved re-implementing or fixing these missing functionalities. The last action observed was an edit to  (Chat Message 405), followed by the AI stating it would continue updating the backend to support all the new functionalities that I added to the frontend (Chat Message 407). This indicates that the current focus is on reconciling the deployed code with the full feature set developed, starting with the frontend and moving to the backend. The nuances include ensuring the newly created React components and their logic are fully integrated and functional, and that the backend API supports these operations as intended.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to continue updating the backend to fully support the new functionalities and fixes being integrated into the frontend.
